- **Automatic Categorization**: ML model automatically assigns categories to expenses based on description and historical data
- **Manual Entry**: Traditional form for manual expense entry
- **Multilingual Support**: Support for Polish and English in voice commands

### üìä Reporting
- **Flexible Reports**: Generate reports by category, time period, and various grouping forms (day/week/month/year)
- **Visualizations**: Advanced charts and graphics showing expense trends
- **Export Formats**: PDF, Excel, and CSV for easy integration with other tools
- **Voice Commands**: Create reports through natural voice instructions

### ü§ñ Integrations
- **Discord Bot**: Remote expense addition through voice messages on Discord
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic reports and confirmations sent via email
- **Machine Learning**: The system improves categorization over time, adapting to user spending patterns

## üõ† Technologies

- **Backend**: Python 3 with Flask framework
- **Frontend**: HTML5, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
